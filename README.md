# Seminar CMXCT 2023: Chapter 13

## Description
This repository contains material related to a presentation for the seminar "Computational Methods for X-Ray Computed Tomography" offered at the Technical University of Munich. The contents are based on the 13th chapter of the book "Computed Tomography: Algorithms, Insight, and Just Enough Theory" by Per Christian Hansen, Jakob Sauer Jorgensen, and William R.B. Lionheart. The focus of this presentation lies on first-order optimization methods used in computed tomography.

## Usage
To run the code please make sure to install the AIR Tools II toolbox by jakobsj (https://github.com/jakobsj/AIRToolsII). \
The function "gradientmethod" takes two arguments, the first one being the choice of step size method ('exact line search', 'backtracking line search', 'BB1 step sizes' and 'BB2 step sizes') and the second being the maximum number of iterations.
